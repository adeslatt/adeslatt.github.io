In this repository, contains how these processes may be kept up-to-date and alert the creator to the functional state of these processes (working or failing) by using a feature found within GitHub called GitHub Actions. This hands-on-course will use a small example to provide the structure, philosophy and approach to achieving this desirable outcome. This course seeks to help to demystify and make accessible powerful methods one can use to achieve platform independence and platform interoperability. Using a simple example to demonstrate these techniques, we will break down and walk the learner through each of the construction steps. The learners will be introduced to Conda, Docker, GitHub and the standard workflow language, Nextflow. If time permits, we will also show how these containerized processes can also be represented in a second standard workflow language implementation (e.g. Common Workflow Language or WDL). By the end of the course, the learner will understand these Elements of Style and will know how Conda, Docker, GitHub, Zenodo, and Nextflow enable repurposable research. Moreover, these steps will be on GitHub for the Learner to return to and reproduce themselves after the end of the course. In taking this course, the Learner will also be shown the power of JupyterLab notebooks to facilitate literate programming. Through their participation in the class, learners will learn and understand FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability) best practices. We ask all participants to get a GitHub, Zenodo and ORCID accounts prior to the course.

By now, we have a GitHub account, an ORCID and hopefully an ERA-Commons ID. This last one will allow us to take advantage of the NIH Researcher Authentication Service. In this portion of the class, we will be registering with Kids First as well as CAVATICA and connecting these two accounts together. Beginning with Kids First Account Some of the data within the Kids First Data Resource Center Hub is registered tier access. What that means is that you simply need to register and the data are available to you. Creating a Kids First DRC Account Please create your account within the Kids First Data Resource Portal. Navigate to Kids First DRC First screen you will see is: From here you can navigate to either CREATE YOUR ACCOUNT or PORTAL LOGIN or CLICK HERE TO GET STARTED Let's click CREATE YOUR ACCOUNT Select a Connection Service A Connection service is used to manage your identity. Let's go ahead and Select a connection service . We have three choices: We have today created our ORCID and perhaps our ERACommons ID and we have the option of selecting Google. Each have their advantages and disadvantages. I'd like to steer you towards the NIH Researcher Authentication Service. The reason is that this is the service that will know what data sets you are authorized to access. Protecting Human Data - Introducing GA4GH Pediatric data, human data are sensitve data. To protect the use of the data, we have data access committees. Data Access Committees is a world-wide phenomenon. In this genomic era, where medicine and research involves many types of omics data, protecting these data means that one registers their intent and that intent is then documented. While today this is an often manual process, we do imagine a future where there is more automation involved, so the process becomes a bit more smoothed out. In the meantime, the NIH Researcher Authentication Service, is one step closer to the ideal. First there is the management of your identity, next is the management of what datasets you have access. The Global Alliance for Genomics & Health (GA4GH) is a policy-framing and technical standards-setting organization, seeking to enable responsible genomic data sharing within a human rights framework. I encourage you to stay abreast with this organization and the emerging policies they are promoting. Logging in with the NIH Researcher Authentication Service Let's choose the NIH Researcher Authentication Service Join Kids First Data Resource Portal You are now asked to enter basic Information after you have connected with Kids First. Enter the information that describes you best. The example on the website is a fictious Researcher. You are asked to agree to adhere to the NIH Genomic Data User Code of Conduct . Some of those terms are recapitulated on the page. Kids First Portal Dashboard Once these terms are accepted - you will be presented with a Dashboard And we are now ready to connect to CAVATICA. Kids First Connect to CAVATICA From the Kids First new user dashboard, we see how to connect to CAVATICA, we see there are three steps.

Creating an account with CAVATICA, repeats some of the steps we followed from the Kids First Portal account creation, but it isn't too much. There is an option to express interest with INCLUDE data, if you think you might be, you become elgible to recieve $100 in cloud credits. You can learn about it by clicking on the screen for more information. After agreeing to the terms and conditions, accepting the privacy policy and proving you are not a robot, we need to have our account verified. Now login with the verified accounts: Generate the Developers Token We need this token to connect the accounts.
