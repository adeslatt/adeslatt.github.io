## Kids First and CAVATICA Account Registrations

Today in this pre-training workshop, we will spend some time to get everyone registered for a few accounts.  By now, we have a GitHub account, an ORCID and hopefully an ERA-Commons ID.  This last one will allow us to take advantage of the NIH Researcher Authentication Service.   In this portion of the class, we will be registering with Kids First as well as CAVATICA and connecting these two accounts together.

## Beginning with Kids First Account

Some of the data within the Kids First Data Resource Center Hub is registered tier access.  What that means is that you simply need to register and the data are available to you.

## Creating a Kids First DRC Account

Please create your account within the Kids First Data Resource Portal.

Navigate to [Kids First DRC](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/)

First screen you will see is:

From here you can navigate to either [CREATE YOUR ACCOUNT](https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/join) or [PORTAL LOGIN]()
or [CLICK HERE TO GET STARTED]()

Let's click [CREATE YOUR ACCOUNT](https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/join)

## Select a Connection Service

A Connection service is used to manage your identity.  

Let's go ahead and [Select a connection service](https://kf-keycloak.kidsfirstdrc.org/auth/realms/kidsfirstdrc/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=portal-ui&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.kidsfirstdrc.org%2F%2Fdashboard&state=110c9ab4-bcce-40d2-8053-8b4f9a1cabc6&response_mode=fragment&response_type=code&scope=openid&nonce=008d154d-280d-4e44-89c9-ecf3cca6231a).

We have three choices:

We have today created our ORCID and perhaps our ERACommons ID and we have the option of selecting Google.

Each have their advantages and disadvantages.   I'd like to steer you towards the NIH Researcher Authentication Service.  The reason is that this is the service that will know what data sets you are authorized to access.

## Protecting Human Data - Introducing GA4GH

Pediatric data, human data are sensitve data.   To protect the use of the data, we have data access committees.   Data Access Committees is a world-wide phenomenon.  In this genomic era, where medicine and research involves many types of omics data, protecting these data means that one registers their intent and that intent is then documented.   While today this is an often manual process, we do imagine a future where there is more automation involved, so the process becomes a bit more smoothed out.   In the meantime, the NIH Researcher Authentication Service, is one step closer to the ideal.   First there is the management of your identity, next is the management of what datasets you have access.   The [Global Alliance for Genomics & Health (GA4GH)](https://www.ga4gh.org/) is a policy-framing and technical standards-setting organization, seeking to enable responsible genomic data sharing within a human rights framework.   I encourage you to stay abreast with this organization and the emerging policies they are promoting. 

## Logging in with the NIH Researcher Authentication Service

Creating an account with CAVATICA, repeats some of the steps we followed from the Kids First Portal account creation, but it isn't too much.   There is an option to express interest with INCLUDE data, if you think you might be, you become elgible to recieve $100 in cloud credits.   You can learn about it by clicking on the screen for more information.

After agreeing to the terms and conditions, accepting the privacy policy and proving you are not a robot, we need to have our account verified.

Now login with the verified accounts:
