# How this site was made

This site was made and is maintained using [MkDocs](mkdocs.org).

It was pretty straight forward to convert the existing GitHub repository structure used for teaching the Elements of Style course.  The tricky part was understanding the deployment aspect.

I did this by understanding the two different functions of this repository.

1. Location for teaching and using MarkDown for the information
2. Website for navigation of the content.

Both of the different functions require their own repositories.

The first repository is the content repository where the information is maintained, added to and altered.
The second repository is the GitHub pages repository where the html information is generated and deployed.

Because this repository is auto-generated, it is important not to edit there, however it still needs to exist.

This was a difficult concept for me to wrap my head around.
